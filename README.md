# About

Hi! My name is Jeremy. I am a web developer with over a decade of experience in creating stunning and functional websites!

Here you can find the source code of my portfolio.

It's built on Astro JS and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## How does the contact form work if GitHub Pages doesn't support POST requests?

I use Cloudflare workers that redirect the POST request to my personal server and process it via PHP.  
Then I return the data as a JSON response with all the information such as status, message and errors.
